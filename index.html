                <span>Mao Zedong[a]</span> <b>(26 December 1893 – 9 September 1976)</b>, also known as Chairman Mao, was

                <span\>Chinese politician</span>,
                    Marxist theorist, military strategist, poet, and revolutionary</span> who was the founder of the
                    <span>People's Republic of
                        China (PRC)</span>. He led the country from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976,
                    while
                    also serving as
                    the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party during that time.<span> His theories, military
                        strategies
                        and policies</span> are
                    known as Maoism.

                    Mao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported<span> Chinese
                        nationalism</span> and had an
                    anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the
                    Xinhai
                    Revolution of 1911 and the May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted
                    <span>Marxism–Leninism</span>
                    while working at
                    Peking University as a librarian. He became a founding member of the<span> Chinese Communist Party
                        (CCP)</span>, leading the
                    Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
                    CCP,
                    Mao
                    helped to found the <span>Chinese Red Army</span>, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land reform
                    policies, and ultimately
                    became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under
                    the
                    Second
                    United Front during the Second <span>Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)</span>, China's civil war resumed
